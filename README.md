# Collections

[![Build Status](http://ci.cartalyst.com/build-status/svg/49)](http://ci.cartalyst.com/build-status/view/49)

A Collections Abstraction library for PHP

The Collection library is one of the most useful things that many modern languages has, but for some reason PHP doesn't has a built in collection layer.

The package requires PHP 5.4+ and follows the FIG standards PSR-1, PSR-2 and PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP.

An open source package by [Cartalyst](https://cartalyst.com), code well, rock on!
